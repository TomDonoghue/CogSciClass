RSA Animate
 
The Royal Society of Arts is an organisation dedicated to trying to find practical solutions to social challenges. Part of it’s mission is to share and promote science. The RSA animate is a program to make animated videos that go along with short (~10 minute) lectures given by scientists and specialists in a range of fields. These videos are well made and accessible lectures - they don’t assume much prior knowledge. You can find all of their videos on their youtube page (https://www.youtube.com/user/theRSAorg). Some of most relevant videos to our class are also linked below.

Programming / Technical Skills
 
	In science, and also industry, programming and technical skills are very often the tools needed to get work done. We urge you to keep up with math as well, although it may not be obvious at the moment, mathematical skills will be a huge boost for a huge number of fields and jobs. In terms of programming, there are a lot of great resources out there, and here we will link to a few that we know and recommend. 
 
Python
	Python is a very common, general purpose language. As of 2016, it’s the third most popular programming language in the world1. The only more popular languages (C and Java) can be considered ‘lower-level’, meaning they are a bit less abstract than Python, and probably a little harder to learn, but they are also important and useful languages, worth checking out if you are interested in computer science.

Resources for Python:
The official website has a lot of good resources. Click on ‘Documentation’ to go to the official tutorials and help documents. 
https://www.python.org/
‘Codecademy’ has some great beginner tutorials that don’t assume any prior programming knowledge, for Python, and also for many other programming languages.
https://www.codecademy.com/
‘Learn Python the Hard Way’ is a book, available free online, that functions as a massive tutorial to learn Python. I recommend it as a great tutorial that I think is a bit better at helping you understand how code works. It’s not actually difficult, the ‘hard’ part refers to it asking you to learn by doing. The tutorials are quite fun, and it quickly gets you started on creating a little text-based video game.

Arduino / Robotics
If you are at all interested in robotics, then look into Arduino, who make micro-processor boards that can easily be used to make little robots with a variety of sensors and effectors. The most basic board is the Uno, about 25$ from Arduino directly or often cheaper from other stores (like Amazon) and there are also a lot of great ‘starter kits’ that come with a range of sensors and extra parts.

The Human Experience
 
	At its most broad, cognitive science is trying to explain how we go around doing what we do, thinking what we think, and feeling what we feel. The scientific method is one approach to these questions, with it’s own strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes a totally different approach seems to capture something about human experience.
