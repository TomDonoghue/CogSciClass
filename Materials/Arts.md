## Generative Art

Generative Art is art that is created with the use of an autonomous system. Often, these are art pieces created or assisted using software and algorithms. For a comprehensive exploration of what generative art is, there is a great article by Maggie Boden [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14626260902867915).

## Spoken Word

At its most broad, cognitive science is trying to explain how we go around doing what we do, thinking what we think, and feeling what we feel. The scientific method is one approach to these questions, with it’s own strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes a totally different approach more easily captures something (else) about the human experience.
