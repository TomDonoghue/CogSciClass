## RSA Animate

The Royal Society of Arts is an organisation dedicated to trying to find practical solutions to social challenges. Part of it’s mission is to share and promote science. The RSA animate is a program to make animated videos that go along with short (~10 minute) lectures given by scientists and specialists in a range of fields. These videos are well made and accessible lectures - they don’t assume much prior knowledge. You can find all of their videos on their youtube page (https://www.youtube.com/user/theRSAorg). Some of most relevant videos to our class are also linked below.
